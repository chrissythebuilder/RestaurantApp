Description: Group project on building an Express application that takes and displays reservations utilizing the use of Bootstrap, jQuery for the UI and Local Storage, Node, and AJAX for the back-end. Once a reservation has been made, these information will be stored as a JSON as part of the 5 reservations OR in the waitlist which will then be generated using AJAX once certain links have been clicked. 

Once user runs Node & go to http://localhost:3000, files will be pulled from the server
